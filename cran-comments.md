## Resumbmission

This is a resubmission. Changes from 0.2.2 to 0.2.3:

* Superflouous \author-fields were removed from the internal,
  unexported functions sym_diff() and myTryCatch(). Credit to
  these persons for their content, which is released under the
  CC BY-SA 4.0 license, is now given in \details, which is much
  more appropriate. I overlooked these two issues in 0.2.2 and
  I apologize for the inconvenience caused.

## Test environments
* macOS-latest, R release (via GitHub Actions)
* macOS-latest, R devel   (via GitHub Actions)

## R CMD check results
